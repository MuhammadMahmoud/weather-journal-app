# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Description
This project have the `server.js` file as a local server and the `website/app.js` file where we build our api function to  get the data from the website and save it on our local server. You can see `index.html` our main page where we insert the zip code and how we feel and it will be updated on our UI and in our local server.

## Extras
- The project has gone throw 3 steps
    - # 1st step
        - in the 1st step we build our local server & styled our main `index.html` page a little
    - # 2nd step
        - in the 2nd step we build our api function on `app.js` and we tested posting and getting data
        from it.
    - # 3rd & final step
        - we changed the direction of our get function to focus on the website instead of getting dummy data from our local server.
